# Character Creation and Customization

In PrimusZ, players can enhance their gameplay through deep character customization. By choosing one of four Character NFTs, players gain unique starting points. These characters can be further personalized by crafting or finding items like weapons and armor, which not only change appearance but also grant new abilities. \

Additionally, players can upgrade their NFT characters using Game Points earned in play, adding another strategic layer to combat, exploration, and survival within the game's immersive world.
