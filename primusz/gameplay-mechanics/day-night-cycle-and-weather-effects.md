# Day-Night Cycle and Weather Effects

In PrimusZ, the day-night cycle and weather not only add realism but also deeply influence your survival tactics. Nightfall might embolden zombies, necessitating stealth and the use of light to navigate. Adverse weather, like rain or snow, can impair visibility and mobility but also offer strategic advantages against both undead and living adversaries. To combat extreme temperatures, finding or crafting appropriate gear is crucial. Preparing for seasonal changes, like gathering resources before winter, can be the difference between life and death in PrimusZ's dynamic environment.
