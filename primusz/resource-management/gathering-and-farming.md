# Gathering and Farming

In PrimusZ, the art of survival extends beyond combat to mastering the land itself through gathering and farming. This sophisticated system allows players to sustain themselves, craft items, and even influence the economy of the game world.

### Gathering

Gathering is a fundamental activity, enabling players to collect various natural resources critical for survival, crafting, and farming.

#### Key Aspects:

* **Resource Types**: Wood, stone, fibers, metals, and edible plants are scattered across the island, each with specific uses in crafting and construction.
* **Tools**: Efficiency in gathering is influenced by the tools at your disposal. Upgrading from basic to advanced tools increases yield and decreases collection time.
* **Environmental Awareness**: Resource availability varies by location, requiring players to explore different zones for specific materials.

### Farming

The farming system in PrimusZ is an expansive module designed for players who wish to cultivate crops, offering a strategic layer to gameplay and resource management.

#### Core Features:

* **Growth Stages**: Crops develop in stages, from planting to harvest, requiring care and attention at each phase.
* **Regrow Options**: Some crops offer regrowth capabilities, providing continuous yields without replanting.
* **Harvest Options**: Players can choose between plucking yield for immediate use or harvesting the entire plant for multiple resources.
* **Crop Quality and Durability**: The farming system calculates crop quality, which can affect the value and effectiveness of the harvest. Durability impacts how long crops last before decaying.

#### Advanced Mechanics:

* **Seasonal Requirements**: Certain crops can only be grown in specific seasons, adding a layer of planning to the farming strategy.
* **Automated Systems**: Utilize UV lamps for indoor growth and sprinkler systems for automated watering, optimizing crop yield.
* **Diverse Plant Types**: The system includes a variety of plant types such as Bush, Dense Leaved Heads, Flowering Head, Long, Stake, Tree, Underground, and Vine, each with specific crops like tomatoes, wheat, bananas, and more.

#### Plant Management:

* **Decay and Death**: Crops have lifecycles and can decay or die if not properly tended, making farm management crucial.
* **Data-Driven**: The system is data table driven, supporting Excel import for easy management and expansion of crop types.

#### Integration:

The farming module is designed to seamlessly connect with other game systems, including inventory, equipment management, and building, providing a holistic gameplay experience.

### Crops Included:

The system includes a diverse array of crops, from staples like potatoes and wheat to exotic fruits like lychee and kiwi, ensuring a rich and varied farming experience.

In PrimusZ, gathering and farming are not just about sustenance; they're about creating a living, breathing ecosystem where your choices shape the world.
