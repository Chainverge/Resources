# Crafting and Building

In PrimusZ, the Crafting and Building systems are pivotal to survival and progression. These interconnected systems allow players to create essential items, weapons, and shelters, enhancing their chances of survival in a world overrun by zombies.

### Crafting System

#### Key Features:

* **Inventory Management**: A robust inventory system supports crafting, with over 250 predefined items and dynamic controls for item management, including splitting, transferring, and combining stacks.
* **Crafting Mechanics**: The system is recipe-based, requiring players to learn or discover recipes before crafting items. Crafting can occur anywhere, provided the player has the necessary components and knowledge.
* **Decay System**: Items within the inventory can decay over time, influenced by environmental factors. This system simulates realistic conditions like refrigeration or spoilage, affecting item usability and requiring strategic resource management.
* **Vendor and Loot Systems**: Integrated vendor systems allow trading of crafted and found items, while loot chests offer randomized rewards, enhancing the crafting and gathering experience.

### Building System

#### Key Features:

* **Ghost Building Placement**: Similar to The Forest, players can plan structures in a 'ghost' mode before finalizing placements, allowing for strategic positioning and modifications.
* **Direct Placement Mode**: Taking cues from ARK: Survival Evolved, this feature allows immediate placement of structures, streamlining the building process.
* **Modular Buildables**: The system supports modular construction with snap logic, enabling the creation of complex structures from simple building blocks, enhanced by trace channels and tags for seamless integration.
* **Placeables**: A variety of placeable objects like campfires, cabinets, and drying racks can be constructed, although these elements contain no inherent logic within this system.
* **Advanced Building Options**: Includes rotation, elevation adjustments, and dynamic extension additions for comprehensive customization of structures.
* **Sustainability Mechanics**: Buildings are subject to damage and require repairs, adding a layer of maintenance and resource management to the survival experience.
* **Spline Building and Surface Alignment**: These features allow for creative construction techniques, such as curved walls or structures that conform to the terrain.

#### Additional Mechanics:

* **Lock System**: Ensures security for player-made structures, safeguarding against unauthorized access.
* **Radial Menu Generation**: Automatically creates a user-friendly interface for building options, categorized for ease of access.

The Crafting and Building systems in PrimusZ are integral to the gameplay, providing a rich and immersive experience. Through crafting, players can equip themselves for survival, while the building system offers a sanctuary against the dangers of the world. Together, these systems foster creativity, strategy, and personalization, making each player's journey unique.
