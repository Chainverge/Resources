# Installation and Setup

PrimusZ offers two versions to cater to diverse player preferences: a Standalone Play2Earn version integrated with blockchain for earning through gameplay, and a non-Play2Earn version on Steam, focusing solely on the gaming experience without blockchain elements. This approach broadens its appeal, accommodating both gamers interested in the Play2Earn aspect and those who prefer traditional gaming.
