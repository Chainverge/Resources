# Setting and Theme

PrimusZ is set on a large, mysterious island marked by a variety of harsh, post-apocalyptic environments, from dense forests and desolate urban areas to treacherous coastlines and rugged mountains. In this theme of survival against the odds, players must navigate a world reclaimed by nature and overrun by zombies, where humanity's remnants are driven to the brink, challenging players to not only survive the landscape and the undead but also the unpredictability of human nature in extreme conditions.
