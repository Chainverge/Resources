# Introduction to PrimusZ

Welcome to the exhilarating world of PrimusZ, a state-of-the-art Play2Earn game meticulously crafted by Chainverge. This introduction, part of Chainverge's GitBook documentation, is designed to guide you through the fundamental aspects of PrimusZ, showcasing its innovative blend of gaming and blockchain technology.

### Game Overview

PrimusZ is an ambitious open-world zombie survival game, engineered using the cutting-edge Unreal Engine 5.3 to deliver an immersive and visually stunning gaming experience. Set on a vast 16 square kilometer island, the game presents a diverse array of environments, from quaint villages to dense forests, each offering unique challenges and opportunities for exploration and survival.

In this treacherous world, players confront hordes of zombies and miscreated creatures, necessitating strategic thinking and adaptability to survive. The game allows for both first-person (FPS) and third-person shooter (TPS) perspectives, accommodating different play styles.

### Multiplayer and Team Dynamics

A standout feature of PrimusZ is its multiplayer capability. Up to 32 players can participate in a single game, fostering a dynamic and competitive environment. Players have the option to form teams of up to four members, encouraging collaboration and team strategy. This team-based play adds a rich layer of interaction, as players must coordinate and leverage their unique abilities to overcome challenges and outsmart opponents.

### Blockchain Integration

PrimusZ integrates blockchain technology, offering a unique gaming experience:

#### Character NFTs

Players begin their journey by acquiring one of several Character NFTs, each with distinctive abilities. These NFTs are more than digital assets; they enhance gameplay and are integral to the Play2Earn mechanics.

#### In-Game Economy

The in-game currency, CVE Tokens, can be earned through gameplay, such as completing quests and resource management. These tokens can be exchanged for CVE Tokens on the Chainverge website, linking in-game achievements with real-world value.

### Play2Earn Mechanics

PrimusZ's Play2Earn model allows players to gain tangible rewards for their gaming skills and strategies. By engaging in various in-game activities, players can accumulate CVE Tokens, which have economic value both within and outside the game.

### Dual Game Versions

To cater to a diverse gaming audience, PrimusZ is available in two versions: a blockchain-based Play2Earn version and a non-crypto version compatible with mainstream gaming platforms like PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam.
