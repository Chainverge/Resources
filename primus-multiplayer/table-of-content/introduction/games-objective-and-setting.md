# Game's Objective and Setting

## **Game Objective**

**Primary Objective: Survival**

* **Survive the Environment:** Players must navigate a post-apocalyptic world teeming with threats. The primary goal is to stay alive, which requires managing health, hunger, thirst, fatigue and weather conditions.
* **Combat Threats:** The undead and potentially hostile players are constant threats. Players must defend themselves, using crafted or found weapons, strategic planning, and sometimes sheer wit.
* **Resource Management:** Essential to survival is the gathering, allocation, and efficient use of resources. This includes food, water, crafting materials, ammunition, and more.
* **Alliance & Strategy:** Players can choose to form alliances with others, sharing resources, building communal bases, and defending against larger threats. However, trust is a luxury, and betrayal is always a possibility.
* **Economic Prosperity:** Beyond mere survival, players can thrive by trading, completing in-game quests, and accumulating Chainverge tokens, integrating the Play2Earn model.

#### **2. Game Setting**

**The Island: A World Reclaimed**

The game unfolds on a vast, sprawling island that once was a hub of civilization but is now overrun by nature and the undead.

* **Urban Desolation:** Abandoned cities, with skyscrapers piercing the sky, now stand silent except for the moans of the undead. These urban areas are rich in resources but also present significant dangers.
* **Rural Wilderness:** Dense forests, serene lakes, and open meadows offer a respite from the urban decay. However, they come with their own set of challenges, from wildlife to hidden threats.
* **Coastal Perils:** The island's coastline, with its beaches and ports, might seem inviting, but they are often the most contested areas, attracting players for their resources.
* **Mountainous Retreats:** High-altitude areas provide a vantage point and natural defense but are challenging to access and survive in due to their harsh conditions.

**Time & Weather Dynamics**

* **Day-Night Cycle:** The passage of time is evident with a dynamic day-night cycle. While daylight offers better visibility and relative safety, nighttime brings increased dangers and challenges.
* **Weather Patterns:** The island experiences a range of weather conditions, from torrential rainstorms to scorching heatwaves. Each weather pattern affects gameplay, resource availability, and player strategies.

**The Threats: Undead & Alive**

* **Zombie Hordes:** The undead are everywhere. From slow-moving roamers to agile hunters, players must learn to identify and combat various zombie types.
* **Human Adversaries:** In a world where resources are scarce, other players can be allies or enemies. Trust is fragile, and alliances can be broken as quickly as they are formed.
