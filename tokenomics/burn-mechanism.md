# - Burn Mechanism

Chainverge has strategically incorporated a burning mechanism into its tokenomics. This mechanism not only regulates the token's supply but also ensures a community-driven approach to its utilization.&#x20;

***

**The Burning Mechanism Explained:**

Every transaction made with Chainverge's native token, CVE, incurs a 1% fee. This fee is bifurcated as follows:

* **0.5% Burn:** This portion of the fee is permanently removed or "burned" from the total supply. This means these tokens are forever taken out of circulation, never to be used or accessed again.\
  **Check Burned Tokens:** Coming Soon...
* **0.5% to Coinsafe:** The other half of the fee is directed to the Coinsafe. Unlike the burned tokens, these tokens are not removed from circulation but are instead placed in a community-governed fund. The utilization of this fund is determined by Chainverge's community through the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) mechanism.\

**Impact on the CVE Token Price:**

* **Supply Reduction and Scarcity:** As tokens are consistently burned with every transaction, the overall supply of CVE tokens decreases over time. A reduced supply, when juxtaposed with a steady or increasing demand, typically leads to an appreciation in value due to the basic economic principle of supply and demand.
* **Community-Driven Value Proposition:** The Coinsafe, governed by the community through the DAO, ensures that the tokens it holds are used in ways that most benefit the ecosystem. Whether it's reinvestment, further token burns, or funding community initiatives, the strategic use of these tokens can drive demand and, by extension, the token's price.
* **Investor Confidence:** A transparent and consistent burning mechanism can bolster investor confidence. It showcases Chainverge's commitment to maintaining token value and ensuring long-term project viability. This confidence can lead to increased buying activity, further driving up the token price.
* **Stabilization and Reduced Price Volatility:** The dual approach of burning and community-driven allocation can act as a stabilizing force. While the burn ensures a steady reduction in supply, the Coinsafe, with its potential for strategic reinvestment, can mitigate sharp price drops by absorbing selling pressure or funding initiatives that boost demand.
