**How to Swap Tokens for CVE or other Tokens on Chainverge's Swap Platform:**

Swapping tokens on Chainverge's platform is a straightforward process that allows users to exchange their existing tokens for CVE tokens. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

1. **Access the Platform:**
   * Navigate to the Chainverge website or open the Chainverge mobile app.
   * Log in using your registered credentials.
2. **Navigate to the Swap Section:**
   * On the main dashboard or menu, click or tap on the 'Swap' option.
3. **Select Your Token:**
   * From the 'From' dropdown menu, select the token you wish to swap. This is the token you currently own and want to exchange.
   * Input the amount of the selected token you wish to swap.
4. **Choose CVE Token:**
   * In the 'To' dropdown menu, select 'CVE Token'.
   * The platform will automatically calculate and display the equivalent amount of CVE tokens you'll receive based on the current exchange rate.
5. **Review the Details:**
   * Check the exchange rate, fees (if any), and the total amount of CVE tokens you'll receive.
   * Ensure you're comfortable with the rates and fees before proceeding.
6. **Initiate the Swap:**
   * Click or tap on the 'Swap Now' or 'Confirm Swap' button.
   * You might be prompted to confirm the transaction, especially if it involves significant amounts or if there are network fees associated.
7. **Authenticate the Transaction:**
   * For added security, the platform may ask you to enter your password, 2FA code, or use other authentication methods.
   * Confirm and authenticate the swap transaction.
8. **Wait for Confirmation:**
   * The swap process will begin, and it might take a few minutes to complete, depending on network congestion and other factors.
   * Once the swap is successful, you'll receive a confirmation notification, and the swapped amount of CVE tokens will reflect in your Chainverge wallet.
9. **Review Your Wallet:**
   * Navigate to your Chainverge wallet to ensure the CVE tokens have been credited.
   * It's also a good practice to check and ensure the deducted amount from the other token is accurate.
10. **Done!**

* You've successfully swapped your tokens for CVE on Chainverge's Swap Platform.

**Note:** Always ensure you're using the official Chainverge platform to avoid scams or phishing sites. It's also recommended to start with a small amount if you're swapping for the first time to familiarize yourself with the process.
