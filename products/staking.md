# - Staking

* **Token Involved:**
  * CVE (Chainverge Token)\
    Stake here: [www.chainverge.net/staking](https://www.chainverge.net/staking)
*   **Staking Rewards:**

    * Users can earn rewards with an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) of up to 102%.


* **Staking Weight (Reward Tiers):** The rewards users receive are based on the amount of CVE they stake, broken down as follows:



| Pool Weight in CVE  | Monthly Staking Reward | Annual Percentage Yield |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| 0 - 5000            | 3%                     | 36%                     |
| 5.000 - 25.000      | 4,5%                   | 54%                     |
| 25.000 - 100.000    | 6%                     | 72%                     |
| 100.000 - 250.000   | 6,5%                   | 78%                     |
| 250.000 - Unlimited | 8,5%                   | 102%                    |



*   **Fees:**

    * There's a 1.5% fee applied both when users stake (enter the staking contract) and unstake (withdraw from the staking contract) their tokens.


*   **Referral System:** Chainverge's staking application integrates a profit-sharing referral system to incentivize users to introduce others to the platform. However, to unlock this referral system, users must stake a minimum of 5,000 CVE tokens.

    * Level 1 Referrals: Earn 15% of the referred user's profit
    * Level 2 Referrals: Earn 5% of the referred user's profit
    * Level 3 Referrals: Earn 3% of the referred user's profit


* **Built-in Price Protection Mechanism:** The staking protocol of Chainverge incorporates a mechanism designed to support a rising token price. Specifically, for every 10% decrease in the Staking Contract Balance, the staking reward is reduced by 10%. This strategy ensures that as the staked amount decreases, the rewards are adjusted to maintain a balance and support the token's value.

***

This built-in mechanism demonstrates Chainverge's commitment to maintaining a stable and growing token value, ensuring the long-term sustainability and attractiveness of the project for both current and potential stakeholders.

***

By introducing the requirement to stake a minimum of 5,000 CVE tokens to unlock the referral system, Chainverge ensures that only committed members of the community can benefit from referring others, further strengthening the project's ecosystem.

**Smart Contract:** Coming Soon...
