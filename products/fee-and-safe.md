# - Fee & Safe

Chainverge incorporates a multifaceted fee structure designed to support the project's growth, stability, and value proposition. These fees not only ensure the project's sustainability but also directly benefit the community through the innovative Coinsafe mechanism.

***

**Transaction Fees:**

* **Burn Fee:** A 0.5% fee on Buy/Sell transactions is instantly burned. This mechanism reduces the total supply of Chainverge tokens over time, creating scarcity and potentially driving up the token's price.
* **Tax Fee:** An additional 0.5% tax is levied on Buy/Sell transactions. This fee serves various purposes, which can be determined by the DAO and the project's needs.

***

**CryptoCard Revenue:**

* **Revenue Allocation:** 50% of the revenue generated from the sale of Chainverge's CryptoCards is directed towards the Chainverge Coinsafe and 50% to the Card Provider.

***

**NFT Royalities:**

* 10% Royalities on every resale, directly funnelled into the Chainverge Coinsafe.

***

**Gaming Revenue:**

* **In-game Fees:** All fees collected from in-game transactions, such as purchases of virtual goods or premium features, are channeled into the Coinsafe.
* **Game Sales Income:** Revenue generated from the sale of Chainverge-developed games also contributes to the Coinsafe's funds.

***

**The Coinsafe Mechanism:**

* **Definition:** The Coinsafe is a specialized smart contract designed to hold and manage funds generated from various Chainverge products and services.
* **Functionality:** The Coinsafe is directly linked with Chainverge products and exchange liquidity. This linkage provides the DAO with a range of possibilities:
  * **Buybacks:** Funds can be used to buy back Chainverge tokens from the open market, potentially increasing demand and price.
  * **Token Burns:** The DAO can decide to burn a portion of the tokens, reducing supply and potentially driving up the token's value.
  * **Staking Pool Increase:** Funds can be channeled to increase the rewards in the staking pool, incentivizing more users to stake their tokens.
  * **Further Development:** The DAO can allocate funds for the development of new products or features.

***

* **DAO's Role:** The Chainverge community, through the DAO, has the authority to decide how the funds in the Coinsafe are utilized. This ensures that the project's direction and financial decisions are truly community-driven.
